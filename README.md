# University Database Case Study

This project models a university system where students are assigned faculty advisers, mentors, and may be connected with alumni.  

It demonstrates:
- Relational modeling
- Entity-relationship diagramming
- Use of primary and foreign keys
- Cardinalities between entities

## Entities
- STUDENT
- FACULTY_ADVISER
- ALUMNUS
- MENTOR

## Relationships
- Each student is assigned exactly one faculty adviser.
- Each student may have zero or one mentor.
- Each mentor works with one faculty adviser.
- A mentor may also be an alumnus.
